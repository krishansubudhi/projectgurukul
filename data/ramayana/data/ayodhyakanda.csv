न हि कञ्चन पश्यामो राघवस्यागुणं वयम्।दुर्लभो ह्यस्य निरय श्शशाङ्कस्येव कल्मषम्।।2.36.27।।, We see no fault in Rama. Unlike the stain in the Moon it is difficult to find any  blemish in him.
अथवा देवि दोषं त्वं कञ्चित्पश्यसि राघवे। तमद्य ब्रूहि तत्वेन तदा रामो विवास्यताम्।।2.36.28।।,O Kaikeyi speak truly if you find any fault in this scion of the Raghu race (Rama). Then he will be exiled.

The will of the overlord of the world should not be done away with.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अयोध्याकाण्डे चतुरुत्तरशततमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the one hundredfourth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki."
[Bharata's lamentation and Rama's consolation.]ततः पुरुषसिंहानां वृतानां तै स्सुहृद्गणैः।शोचतामेव रजनी दुःखेन व्यत्यवर्तत।।2.105.1।।," That night passed off painfully for the four lion like brothers as they lamented, surrounded by their hosts of friends."

तूष्णीं ते समुपासीना न कश्चित्किञ्चिदब्रवीत्।भरतस्तु सुहृन्मध्ये रामं वचनमब्रवीत्।।2.105.3।।,All of them sat together silently and no one uttered a word. Bharata alone from among  them addressed Rama saying:
सान्त्विता मामिका माता दत्तं राज्यमिदं मम।तद्ददामि तवैवाहं भुङ्क्ष्व राज्यमकण्टकम्।।2.105.4।।,This kingdom was given to me for the satisfaction of my mother. I am bestowing it back on you. Enjoy it without any obstacles.
महतेवाम्बुवेगेन भिन्नस्सेतुर्जलागमे।दुरावारं त्वदन्येन राज्यखण्डमिदं महत्।।2.105.5।।,"Like a dyke bursts under pressure by the great surge of waters during the rainy season, this vast kingdom cannot be sustained by any one except yourself."
गतिं खर इवाश्वस्य तार्क्ष्यस्येव पतत्रिणः।अनुगन्तुं न शक्तिर्मे गतिं तव महीपते।।2.105.6।।,"O lord of the earth as an ass cannot follow the pace of a horse or a bird, the pace of Tarkshya (Garuda), I do not have the capability to follow you."
सुजीवं नित्यशस्तस्य यः परैरुपजीव्यते।राम तेन तु दुर्जीवं यः परानुपजीवति।।2.105.7।।,"O Rama, the life of a man on whom others depend for their sustenance is a happy life and the life of one who depends on others for his own mintenance is miserable.  "
यथा तु रोपितो वृक्षः पुरुषेण विवर्धितः।ह्रस्वकेण दुरारोहो रूढस्कन्धो महाद्रुमः।।2.105.8।।स यदा पुष्पितो भूत्वा फलानि न विदर्शयेत्।स तां नानुभवेत्प्रीतिं यस्य हेतोः प्ररोपितः।।2.105.9।।एषोपमा महाबाहो तमर्थं वेत्तु मर्हसि।यदि त्वमस्मान्वृषभो भर्ता भृत्यान्न शाधि हि।।2.105.10।।,"O mightyarmed Rama, a man plants a tree, rears it till it grows into such a large tree with a big trunk that it becomes difficult for a dwarf to climb. When the tree flowers but does not bear fruit, the man who planted it gets no pleasure out of the purpose for which the tree was planted. Being a mighty protector, do not chastise us who are your servants. This is a simile. You may better comprehend its implications.(The meaning of the simile is that if you do not assume the throne, the desire of our father, who nurtured you right from your childhood and hoped that one day you will become king and rule the people, will be in vain.)"
श्रेणयस्त्वां महाराज पश्यन्त्वग्य्राश्च सर्वशः।प्रतपन्तमिवादित्यं राज्ये स्थित मरिन्दमम्।।2.105.11।।,"O great king and subduer of enemies, may all the leading guilds of traders and other subjects behold you all over installed in the kingdom like the resplendent Sun."
तवानुयाने काकुत्स्थ मत्ता नर्दन्तु कुञ्जराः।अन्तःपुरगता नार्यो नन्दन्तु सुसमाहिताः।।2.105.12।।,"O Rama, let the elephants following you, intoxicated with ichor, be heard trumpeting. Let the women of the inner apartment rejoice with composed minds (when they hear of your return)."
तस्य साध्वित्यमन्यन्त नागरा विविधा जनाः।भरतस्य वच श्श्रुत्वा रामं प्रत्यनुयाचतः।।2.105.13।।,"Hearing the words of Bharata beseeching Rama to return, various classes of people of the city of Ayodhya, in approbation exclaimed well said."
तमेवं दुःखितं प्रेक्ष्य विलपन्तं यशस्विनम्।रामः कृतात्मा भरतं समाश्वासयदात्मवान्।।2.105.14।।,"Having seen the illustrious Bharata lamenting that way, Rama, a man of firm determination and selfpossession, consoled him thus:"
नाऽत्मनः कामकारोऽस्ति पुरुषोऽयमनीश्वरः।इतश्चेतरतश्चैनं कृतान्तः परिकर्षति।।2.105.15।।,A man is neither independent nor competent to do any act on his free will. Fate pulls him this way or the other.
सर्वे क्षयान्ताः निचयाः पतनान्ता समुच्छ्रयाः।संयोगा विप्रयोगान्ता मरणान्तं च जीवितम्।।2.105.16।।,All accumulations of wealth deplete at the end. Every man who attains elevated positions falls at the end. Every union culminates in separation. Every life ends in death.
यथा फलानां पक्वानां नान्यत्र पतनाद्भयम्।एवं नरस्य जातस्य नान्यत्र मरणाद्भयम्।।2.105.17।।,The only fear of a ripened fruit is the fear of falling down (from the tree). In the same way every man who is born has no other fear except the fear of death.
यथाऽगारं दृढस्थूणं जीर्णं भूत्वाऽवसीदति।तथैव सीदन्ति नरा जरामृत्युवशं गताः।।2.105.18।।,Even a house constructed with sturdy pillars gets dilapidated and ultimately decays. In the same way people under the sway of old age and death are destroyed (at last).
अत्येति रजनी या तु सा न प्रतिनिवर्तते।यात्येव यमुना पूर्णा समुद्रमुदकाकुलम्।।2.105.19।।,A night that once passe off does not return like the waters of river Yamuna that flow into the ocean filled with water (the water do not flow back into Yamuna).
अहोरात्राणि गच्छन्ति सर्वेषां प्राणिनामिह।अायूंषि क्षपयन्त्याशु ग्रीष्मे जलमिवांशवः।।2.105.20।।,"The passing days and nights quickly decrease the life span of all living beings in this world, like sunrays drying up the water in summer."
आत्मानमनुशोच त्वं किमन्यमनुशोचसि।आयुस्ते हीयते यस्य स्थितस्य च गतस्य च।।2.105.21।।,"Whether you are static or moving, your lifespan decreases. Therefore, you should only grieve about yourself and not for any one else. "
सहैव मृत्युर्व्रजति सह मृत्युर्निषीदति।गत्वासुदीर्घमध्वानं सहमृत्युर्निवर्तते।।2.105.22।।,"Death follows a man wherever he goes. When he sits, death sits with him. Even after travelling a very long distance, the man returns along with death."

"नन्दन्त्युदित आदित्ये नन्दन्त्यस्तमितेऽहनि।

आत्मनो नावबुध्यन्ते मनुष्या जीवितक्षयम्।।2.105.24।।
 ","
People rejoice when the Sun rises and rejoice when the Sun sets. But they are unaware of the decline of the life span of their own."
हृष्यन्त्यृतुमुखं दृष्ट्वा नवं नवमिहागतम्।ऋतूनां परिवर्तेन प्राणिनां प्राणसङ्क्षयः।।2.105.25।।,At the advent of each new season men feel delighted to see the newly blossomed flowers and fruits. But with the change of the scasons the life span also diminishes.
"यथा काष्ठं च काष्ठं च समेयातां महार्णवे।

(So) why should a man grieve?"
वयसः पतमानस्य स्रोतसो वाऽनिवर्तिनः।आत्मा सुखे नियोक्तव्यस्सुखभाजः प्रजाः स्मृताः।।2.105.31।।,"Like the flow of water which never reverts to its source, age passes. Therefore, a man must employ his self in righteous acts that bring him happiness. By doing so, it is said, people will always be happy."
